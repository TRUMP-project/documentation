# week2

-Creation of a file (to be uploaded) summing up the databases found until now, with the kind on data available, the period, population data level etc.
-Edited the presentation with the logos of the ISSH and VU.
-Started the process of contacting the COA (Centraal Orgaan opvang asielzoekers) to see if the can provide any data. Today they had some problem with their website, but they said later this week it should work again.
-Emailed the research assistant of the project "Measuring and Improving City Livability" to see if it possible to collaborate or if they might have some useful data. They are using neighbourhood data and might have something we can use.

-Moreover the Vluchtelingen Werk has not answered yet, but it might take a while since they have lots of requests at the moment.
