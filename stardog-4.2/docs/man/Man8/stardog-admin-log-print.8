\fB\-d\fR \fIdelimeter\fR, \fB\-\-delimeter\fR \fIdelimeter\fR

\fB\-\-filter\fR \fIfilter\fR
Filter expressions to hide certain events\. A filter expression is in the form \'field op value\' where field is one of the fields defined in \-\-field option, op is one of \'=\', \'\fI\', \'<=\', \'\fR\', \'>=\', or \'~\', and value should be a valid value for the field\. For example,filter expression for time field should use xsd:date or xsd:dateTime values\. The op \'~\' represents regular expression matching where value should be a valid Java regular expression and should match the entire value of the given field\.
